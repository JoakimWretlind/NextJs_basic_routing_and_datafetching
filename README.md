### Background
I wanted to make an app that fetches data from an API and that uses dynamic routing and Static Site Generation (SSG) - as simple as possible.

### API
For the data I am using dummy data from *jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/*

### Tools
![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Next.JS-white?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=000000)
![Styled Cmoponents](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Styled%20Components-white?style=for-the-badge&logo=styled-components&logoColor=DB7093)

### Live Version
(https://next-js-basic-routing-and-datafetching.vercel.app/).

### Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
