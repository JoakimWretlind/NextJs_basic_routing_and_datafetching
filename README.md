### Background
I wanted to make an app that fetches data from an API and that uses dynamic routing and Static Site Generation (SSG) - as simple as possible.

### API
For the data I am using dummy data from *jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/*

### Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
